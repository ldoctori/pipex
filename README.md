This project is about the redirection and pipe. The program must simulate execution of two shell command with some flags and files paths as in/out parameters. It can be seen from figure, that execution of ./pipex program with parameters list of 'helpers.c "cat -e" "grep exit" your_out.txt' corresponds to shell comand '< helpers.c cat -e | grep exit > out.txt'
